//Task 7: Write a program to check if a number is a leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) and log the result to the console

const year = 4;

if(year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !==0 || year % 400 === 0){
    console.log(`The year ${year} is a leap year`);
}
else 
    console.log(`The year ${year} is not leap year`);
