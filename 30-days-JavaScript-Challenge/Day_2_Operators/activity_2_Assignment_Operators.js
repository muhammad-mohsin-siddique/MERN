//Task 6: use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console 

let number = 3.5;
let number2 = 3.5;

number += number2; //It is same as number = number + number2;

console.log(number); // addition of two numbers result will display in the console


//Now can retrieve the value of number2 but not the original value of number variable because it is updated

//In assembly Language which low level Language we use add cx,dx and the result store in the cx after addition


//Task 7: use the -= operator to subtract a number to a variable and log the result to the console 

let number3 = 3.5;
let number4 = 3.5;

number3 -= number4; //It is same as number = number - number2;

console.log(number3); // Subtraction of two numbers result will display in the console


// Same we can use *=, /= , %=
